# IndividualStudy
## Individual study of Algorithms and Data Structures ##

The overall purpose of the individual study is to explore more complex software programming concepts that is beyond the scope of ECE 309. Below is the list of topics that I have covered in the span of 4 months, which includes sorting algorithms, data structures and programming techniques and algorithms. This study can also help identify more relevant topics that can be integrated to ECE 309, or other courses in the CPE curriculum.
