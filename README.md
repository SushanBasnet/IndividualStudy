# IndividualStudy
## Individual study of Algorithms and Data Structures ##

The overall purpose of the individual study is to explore more complex software programming concepts that is beyond the scope of ECE 309.  Some of the topics I intend to cover include sorting algorithms, data structures and programming techniques and algorithms. The study can also help identify more relevant topics that can be integrated to ECE 309, or other courses in the CPE curriculum.

### Sorting Algorithms ###
Nlog(N) Sorting Algorithms and their runtime complexity analysis (1-2 weeks)

	* Implement Quicksort, Mergesort
	
	* Analyze runtime complexity 
	
	* Discuss tradeoffs and optimize for best/worst/average case performance
	
	* Experiment with size of Data set, # of comparisons, retrieval from Disk vs RAM
	
### Data Structures ###

Binary Tree Data Structure (1 week)

	* Be Familiar with different traversals (Recursive and iterative)
	
	* Solve related problems: Validating Trees, Common ancestors
	
Graphs (2 weeks)

	* Be Familiar with graph traversals (BFS, DFS)
	
	* Implement shortest path (Dijkstra’s Algorithm)
	
	* Finding cycles in directed graph + Tarjan’s algorithm
	
	* Converting transitive equations to graphs
	
	* Deep copy of graphs
	
	* Research about Application on computer networks

Possible Project Idea:

	* Software Cache with O(1) insert and retrieval time

### Programming Techniques ###

Sliding Window Technique (0.5 week)

	* Converting O(N^2) solutions to O(N)
	
Greedy Algorithms (0.5 week)

	* Knapsack Type Problem (fractional)
	
Divide and Conquer (1 week)

	* Mergesort
	
	* Sorted 2D Matrix Search using Divide & Conquer
	
Recursion & Backtracking (1 week)

	* Generate N combinations and permutations 
	
	* Largest island problems
	
	* N Queens problem
	
Dynamic Programming (2 weeks)

	* Learn about Top-down and Bottom-up approaches
	
	* Runtime analysis with and without DP 
	
	* Knapsack type problems (non-fractional), Memoization tables
	
	* Report on the application of DP in the industry
	
	Possible Project Ideas:
		1. Solve 2D maze problems with backtracking
		2. Word Search puzzle solver using computer vision libraries
